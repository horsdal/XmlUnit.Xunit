XMLUnit for .Net
================

To run this software you will need:
- Nunit v2.2 or above (http://nunit.org/)
- .NET runtime v1.1 or Mono runtime v1.0 (or above)

If you want to build the source code yourself you will also need NAnt
(http://nant.sourceforge.net/)

This build of the source code was prepared using .NET csc 1.1.4322,
NUnit2.4.8, and NAnt0.8.5

Enjoy!

Changes in version 0.4:
- order of attributes is ignored, this means there will never be a
  difference of type 4 anymore.

  A new flag in DifferenceConfiguration can be used to turn on the old
  behavior where attribute order was significant.

- xmlns attributes are now no longer treated as normal attributes and
  the namespace of attributes is now sigificant

- comparisions of empty elements with attributes failed.
  I.e. <foo><bar x="1"/></foo> was considered different from
  <foo><bar x="1"></bar></foo>
